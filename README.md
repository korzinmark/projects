# projects
Hello!
Here you can see my projects. All the design and development I did myself. 
Both projects were for my friend. 

The first project I made at the end of 2021. This is a pretty simple landing page website dedicated to my friend's dog (corgi_project). 
On this site, with the help of native JS and some JS libraries the following was done: 
a hamburger menu for mobile versions 
a slider for the gallery [(slick-slider library)](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)
form validation before sending [(jquery validation plugin)](https://jqueryvalidation.org/)
smooth scroll up
closing the modal window 
form sending


The second project is an online store of posters and merch. 
I hope you appreciate :)
